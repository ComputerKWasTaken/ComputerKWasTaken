# Hello!

My name is Archer Hosford, and I'm a beginner Python programmer, trying to learn new things and try things out.

I'm not currently working on anything.

I'm currently learning about the basics of Python, and I'm trying to learn how to use the Pygame module.

I also use Open AI's Codex model

Thanks!
